4. Deploying on Render
-Create a New Web Service on Render
Go to Render.
Log in or sign up for an account.

*Application Functionality
1. Calendar
The calendar highlights the current date and allows users to select any date.
Events are linked to specific dates.

2. Events
Users can view all events for a selected date.
Events are displayed with their method and description.

3. Add Event
Users can add a new event by specifying:
Method (e.g., email, call, LinkedIn post).
Description (details about the event).

4. Delete Event
Events can be deleted individually from the event list.

*Known Limitations
-Persistent Storage:
Currently, events are stored in memory. Once the page is refreshed, events will be lost.
To overcome this, consider integrating a backend or browser-based storage like localStorage.

-Event Overlap:
Thereâ€™s no warning for overlapping events. Adding validation to handle this would be an enhancement.

-Event Editing:
Events cannot be edited after being added. A feature to modify existing events could be implemented in the future.

Future Improvements
-Integration with a backend for persistent data storage.
-Adding user authentication to allow personalized calendars.
-Support for recurring events and reminders.
-Mobile-friendly design improvements.
